Oliver Wyman conducted a broad market survey of US and Canadian utilities and contacted many regulators directly to assess how common productivity measures were used. In total we made over 350 contacts to:
-In Canada: 20 utilities and 8 Commissions
-In the US: 11 utilities and 9 Commissions

This research found:
- No commission was found to routinely measure productivity directly. Instead commissions focused on 'outcome' metrics of overall Service Quality Metrics (SQM) and total costs. In the majority of cases, the commissions directed us to contact utilities directly as the management of productivity was considered part of their internal management.
- Most utilities did look at productivity metrics internally as part of a balanced scorecard to support understanding of trends of the SQM and Cost metrics reported to commissions. The productivity metrics found suggest that none of the participants track productivity across all business functions.
